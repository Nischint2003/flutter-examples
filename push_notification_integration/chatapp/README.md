# push-notification-integration-chatapp

A new Flutter project on push message integration

## Getting Started


The chat app using firebase authentication and firebase_messaging for push notifications is a great example of how to integrate these two powerful Firebase features.

Firebase Authentication provides a simple and secure way to authenticate users in your app. Firebase Messaging allows you to send push notifications to your users' devices, even when your app is not running.

To integrate Firebase Authentication and Firebase Messaging into your chat app, you will need to follow these steps:

Create a Firebase project and add your app.
Enable Firebase Authentication and Firebase Messaging for your app.
Initialize Firebase Authentication and Firebase Messaging in your app.
Authenticate users in your app using Firebase Authentication.
Get the device push token for each user's device.
Store the device push token in your database.
When a user sends a message to another user, send a push notification to the recipient's device using Firebase Messaging.
